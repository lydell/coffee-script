# Upgrade `@param`s to CoffeeScript 1.9.0+

CoffeeScript versions prior to 1.9.0 accidentally allowed this:

```coffee
class Person
  constructor: (@name) ->
    console.log(name)
```

In CoffeeScript 1.9.0+ the above will throw a `ReferenceError` since youâ€™re
trying to log an undefined variable. The correct way to write it is:

```coffee
class Person
  constructor: (@name) ->
    console.log(@name)
```

In other words, you used to be able to access `@param`s without the `@`, but
cannot anymore.

This mod of the CoffeeScript compiler `console.error`s each occurance where you
are missing a `@`.

To install it:

```sh
npm install lydell/coffee-script#1.8-at-params-warn
```

To check a file for missing `@`s, run for example:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/coffee -p file-to-check.coffee >/dev/null
```

Fix all warnings and then you should be good to go to upgrade to CoffeeScript
1.9.0+!
